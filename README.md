# weeks-left

## todo

* display number of weeks left over image
* modal/sidebar for birthdate and expected lifetime
  - add input fields to index.html for birthdate and expected lifetime
  - call `weeksLeft()` with values from form
* set birthdate, expectedLifetimeInDays to `localStorage` on input field exit event 
* retrieve birthdate, expectedLifetimeInDays from `localStorage` on `DOMContentLoaded` event



## what are the ideas that arise when creating this?

* would a templating system like handlebars be helpful?
* would WeeksLeft, Background components be a useful abstraction?
* simple build and test scripts would be helpful.
* javascript code splitting, building
